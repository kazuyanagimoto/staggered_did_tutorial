We propose new empirical strategies in both cases. We also consider two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions that include time-varying regressors, which is the most common way that DID identification strategies are implemented under conditional parallel trends. We show that, even in the case with only two time periods, these TWFE regressions are not generally robust to (i) time-varying covariates being affected by the treatment, (ii) treatment effects and/or paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on the level of time-varying covariates in addition to only the change in the covariates over time, (iii) treatment effects and/or paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant covariates, (iv) treatment effect heterogeneity with respect to observed covariates, and (v) violations of strong functional form assumptions, both for outcomes over time and the propensity score, that are unlikely to be plausible in most DID applications. Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver misleading estimates of causal effect parameters in a number of empirically relevant cases.

            We estimate the effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs using 138 prominent state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016 in the United States using a difference-in-differences approach. We first estimate the effect of the minimum wage increase on employment changes by wage bins throughout the hourly wage distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribution and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We also show how decomposing the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing the plausibility of estimates.},

The two-stage approach is robust to treatment-effect heterogeneity under staggered adoption, and can be used to identify a host of different average treatment effect measures. It is also simple, intuitive, and easy to implement.

            This paper proposes tools for robust inference in difference-in-differences and event-study designs where the parallel trends assumption may be violated. Instead of requiring that parallel trends holds exactly, we impose restrictions on how different the post-treatment violations of parallel trends can be from the pre-treatment differences in trends (“pre-trends”). The causal parameter of interest is partially identified under these restrictions. We introduce two approaches that guarantee uniformly valid inference under the imposed restrictions, and we derive novel results showing that they have desirable power properties in our context. We illustrate how economic knowledge can inform the restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends in two economic applications. We also highlight how our approach can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses showing what causal conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the possible violations of the parallel trends assumption.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses when the validity of diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences depends on functional form. We provide a novel characterization: the parallel trends assumption holds under all strictly monotonic transformations of the outcome if and only if a stronger “parallel trends”-type condition holds for the cumulative distribution function of untreated potential outcomes. This condition for parallel trends to be insensitive to functional form is satisﬁed if and essentially only if the population can be partitioned into a subgroup for which treatment is eﬀectively randomly assigned and a remaining subgroup for which the distribution of untreated potential outcomes is stable over time. These conditions have testable implications, and we introduce falsiﬁcation tests for the null that parallel trends is insensitive to functional form.},

We begin by articulating a simple set of ``canonical'' assumptions under which the econometrics of DiD are well-understood. We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classified as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on \$(i)\$ multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, \$(ii)\$ potential violations of parallel trends, or \$(iii)\$ alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly specified. We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

	abstract = {Applied work often studies the effect of a binary variable (“treatment”) using linear models with additive effects. I study the interpretation of the OLS estimands in such models when treatment effects are heterogeneous. I show that the treatment coefﬁcient is a convex combination of two parameters, which under certain conditions can be interpreted as the average treatment effects on the treated and untreated. The weights on these parameters are inversely related to the proportion of observations in each group. Reliance on these implicit weights can have serious consequences for applied work, as I illustrate with two well-known applications. I develop simple diagnostic tools that empirical researchers can use to avoid potential biases. Software for implementing these methods is available in R and Stata. In an important special case, my diagnostics require only the knowledge of the proportion of treated units.},

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},
